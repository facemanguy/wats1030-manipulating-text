So after getting used to all the oddities of each editor I can soundly say that I am team VI. I found Nano to be alright for most tasks but a bit underwhelming in areas. VI had a steep learning curve but once I understood it was way easier to use than the others for me. I still catch myself not putting it into insert mode out of inexperience but that is much more managable than not knowing what my command did. Emacs was actually difficult for me with quitting out or exiting ironically confusing. Emacs seems nice if I know exactly what I need to change as its much quicker. I perfer Vi for any actual editing though as my actions feel much safer and under control.
